# Frontend Changes - Combined Features

## Overview
This document covers three major enhancements: two backend enhancements (Code Quality Tools and Testing Framework) that support the frontend application, and one frontend enhancement (Theme Toggle).

## Feature 1: Code Quality Tools Implementation

### Overview
Added essential code quality tools to the development workflow, focusing on automatic code formatting with Black and development scripts for maintaining code consistency.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Code Formatter Setup
- **Added Black as development dependency**: Added `black>=25.1.0` to the project's development dependencies using `uv add --dev black`
- **Black configuration**: Added comprehensive Black configuration in `pyproject.toml` with:
  - Line length: 88 characters
  - Target version: Python 3.13
  - Proper exclusion patterns for common directories (`.venv`, `build`, `dist`, etc.)

#### 2. Code Formatting Applied
- **Formatted entire codebase**: Applied Black formatting to all 16 Python files in the project
- **Files reformatted**:
  - `backend/config.py`
  - `backend/models.py` 
  - `backend/run_tests.py`
  - `backend/tests/__init__.py`
  - `backend/session_manager.py`
  - `backend/app.py`
  - `backend/rag_system.py`
  - `backend/ai_generator.py`
  - `backend/document_processor.py`
  - `backend/search_tools.py`
  - `backend/vector_store.py`
  - All test files in `backend/tests/`

#### 3. Development Scripts
Created a comprehensive set of development scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

##### `scripts/format.sh`
- Formats all Python code using Black
- Provides user-friendly output with emojis and status messages
- Uses `uv run black .` to format the entire codebase

##### `scripts/check-format.sh`
- Checks code formatting without making changes
- Uses `black --check --diff` to show formatting issues
- Returns appropriate exit codes for CI/CD integration
- Provides clear feedback on formatting status

##### `scripts/quality-check.sh`
- Comprehensive quality check script
- Currently includes formatting checks
- Designed to be extensible for future quality tools
- Provides detailed summary of all checks
- Returns proper exit codes for automation

### Benefits
1. **Consistent Code Style**: All Python code now follows Black's opinionated formatting standards
2. **Development Efficiency**: Developers can quickly format and check code with simple commands
3. **CI/CD Ready**: Scripts return proper exit codes for integration with automated workflows
4. **Maintainable**: Clear documentation and organized script structure
5. **Extensible**: Quality check framework can easily accommodate additional tools

## Feature 2: Testing Framework Enhancement

### Overview
This feature enhancement focused on **backend testing infrastructure** rather than frontend changes. The work involved enhancing the existing testing framework for the RAG system's backend API endpoints.

### Changes Made

#### Backend Testing Infrastructure
- **Enhanced pytest configuration** in `pyproject.toml`
- **Created comprehensive test fixtures** in `backend/tests/conftest.py`
- **Implemented API endpoint tests** in `backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py`

#### Files Modified/Created

##### 1. `pyproject.toml`
- Added test dependencies: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `httpx`, `pytest-mock`
- Configured pytest settings with proper test discovery patterns
- Added test markers for `unit`, `integration`, and `api` tests
- Set asyncio mode to `auto` for proper async test handling

##### 2. `backend/tests/conftest.py` (New)
- Created shared test fixtures for mocking RAG system components
- Sample data fixtures for courses, lessons, and chunks
- Mock fixtures for vector store, document processor, session manager
- Test environment setup and cleanup utilities

##### 3. `backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py` (New)
- Comprehensive API endpoint tests for `/api/query`, `/api/courses`, and root endpoints
- Test cases for successful responses, error handling, and edge cases
- Request/response validation tests
- Created isolated test app to avoid static file mounting issues
- Proper mocking of RAG system dependencies

#### Testing Coverage Added
- **API endpoint functionality**: All FastAPI routes tested
- **Request/response validation**: Pydantic model validation testing  
- **Error handling**: Server errors and validation errors
- **Edge cases**: Empty queries, long queries, missing session IDs
- **Response structure**: Ensuring API contracts are maintained

#### Test Results
- **12 new API tests** added and passing
- **59 total tests** in the complete test suite
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Clean separation of concerns with isolated test fixtures

## Combined Usage
```bash
# Format all code
./scripts/format.sh

# Check formatting without changes
./scripts/check-format.sh

# Run all quality checks
./scripts/quality-check.sh

# Direct uv commands
uv run black .                    # Format code
uv run black --check --diff .     # Check formatting
```

## Frontend Impact
While both features focused on **backend enhancements**, they provide significant benefits for frontend development:

### Code Quality Benefits
- Consistent code style across the entire backend API
- Reduced merge conflicts due to formatting standardization
- Faster code reviews with automated formatting

### Testing Benefits
- Enhanced API testing provides confidence that frontend applications can reliably interact with the backend endpoints
- The API tests ensure that:
  - Frontend can successfully query the RAG system via `/api/query`
  - Course statistics are available via `/api/courses`
  - Proper error responses are returned for invalid requests
  - Session management works correctly across API calls

## Future Enhancements
The combined framework is designed to be extensible. Future additions could include:

### Code Quality
- Static type checking with mypy
- Code linting with flake8 or ruff
- Import sorting with isort
- Security scanning with bandit
- Test coverage reporting

### Testing Infrastructure
- Easy addition of new API endpoint tests
- Comprehensive mocking of system dependencies
- Proper async testing patterns (if needed)
- Clear separation between unit, integration, and API tests

## Feature 3: Frontend Theme Toggle Implementation

### Overview
Added a dark/light theme toggle feature to the Course Materials Assistant frontend with smooth transitions and full accessibility support.

### Changes Made

#### 1. HTML Structure (index.html)
- Added theme toggle button with sun/moon SVG icons positioned in top-right corner
- Button includes proper ARIA labels for accessibility

#### 2. CSS Styling (style.css)
