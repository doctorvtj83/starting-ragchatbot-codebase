# Frontend Changes

## Note on Testing Framework Enhancement

This feature enhancement focused on **backend testing infrastructure** rather than frontend changes. The work involved enhancing the existing testing framework for the RAG system's backend API endpoints.

## Changes Made

### Backend Testing Infrastructure
- **Enhanced pytest configuration** in `pyproject.toml`
- **Created comprehensive test fixtures** in `backend/tests/conftest.py`
- **Implemented API endpoint tests** in `backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py`

### Files Modified/Created

#### 1. `pyproject.toml`
- Added test dependencies: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `httpx`, `pytest-mock`
- Configured pytest settings with proper test discovery patterns
- Added test markers for `unit`, `integration`, and `api` tests
- Set asyncio mode to `auto` for proper async test handling

#### 2. `backend/tests/conftest.py` (New)
- Created shared test fixtures for mocking RAG system components
- Sample data fixtures for courses, lessons, and chunks
- Mock fixtures for vector store, document processor, session manager
- Test environment setup and cleanup utilities

#### 3. `backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py` (New)
- Comprehensive API endpoint tests for `/api/query`, `/api/courses`, and root endpoints
- Test cases for successful responses, error handling, and edge cases
- Request/response validation tests
- Created isolated test app to avoid static file mounting issues
- Proper mocking of RAG system dependencies

### Testing Coverage Added
- **API endpoint functionality**: All FastAPI routes tested
- **Request/response validation**: Pydantic model validation testing  
- **Error handling**: Server errors and validation errors
- **Edge cases**: Empty queries, long queries, missing session IDs
- **Response structure**: Ensuring API contracts are maintained

### Test Results
- **12 new API tests** added and passing
- **59 total tests** in the complete test suite
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Clean separation of concerns with isolated test fixtures

## Frontend Impact
Since this was a **backend-focused enhancement**, there are no direct frontend changes. However, the enhanced API testing provides confidence that frontend applications can reliably interact with the backend endpoints.

The API tests ensure that:
- Frontend can successfully query the RAG system via `/api/query`
- Course statistics are available via `/api/courses`
- Proper error responses are returned for invalid requests
- Session management works correctly across API calls

## Future Considerations
The enhanced testing infrastructure now supports:
- Easy addition of new API endpoint tests
- Comprehensive mocking of system dependencies
- Proper async testing patterns (if needed)
- Clear separation between unit, integration, and API tests
